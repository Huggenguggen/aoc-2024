# Day 20 (2024)

`Race Condition` ([prompt](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/20))

While The Historians get to work, a nearby program sees that you're idle and challenges you to a race. Apparently, you've arrived just in time for the frequently-held race condition festival!

The race takes place on a particularly long and twisting code path; programs compete to see who can finish in the fewest picoseconds. The winner even gets their very own mutex!

They hand you a map of the racetrack (your puzzle input). For example:
```
###############
#...#...#.....#
#.#.#.#.#.###.#
#S#...#.#.#...#
#######.#.#.###
#######.#.#...#
#######.#.###.#
###..E#...#...#
###.#######.###
#...###...#...#
#.#####.#.###.#
#.#...#.#.#...#
#.#.#.#.#.#.###
#...#...#...###
###############
```

The map consists of track (.) - including the start (S) and end (E) positions (both of which also count as track) - and walls (#).

When a program runs through the racetrack, it starts at the start position. Then, it is allowed to move up, down, left, or right; each such move takes 1 picosecond. The goal is to reach the end position as quickly as possible. In this example racetrack, the fastest time is 84 picoseconds.

Because there is only a single path from the start to the end and the programs all go the same speed, the races used to be pretty boring. To make things more interesting, they introduced a new rule to the races: programs are allowed to cheat.

The rules for cheating are very strict. Exactly once during a race, a program may disable collision for up to 2 picoseconds. This allows the program to pass through walls as if they were regular track. At the end of the cheat, the program must be back on normal track again; otherwise, it will receive a segmentation fault and get disqualified.

a program could complete the course in 64 picoseconds (saving 20 picoseconds) by cheating for the two moves marked 1 and 2:
```
###############
#...#...#.....#
#.#.#.#.#.###.#
#S#...#.#.#...#
#######.#.#.###
#######.#.#...#
#######.#.###.#
###..E#...12..#
###.#######.###
#...###...#...#
#.#####.#.###.#
#.#...#.#.#...#
#.#.#.#.#.#.###
#...#...#...###
###############
```
Each cheat has a distinct start position (the position where the cheat is activated, just before the first move that is allowed to go through walls) and end position; cheats are uniquely identified by their start position and end position.

In this example, the total number of cheats (grouped by the amount of time they save) are as follows:

There are 14 cheats that save 2 picoseconds.
There are 14 cheats that save 4 picoseconds.
There are 2 cheats that save 6 picoseconds.
There are 4 cheats that save 8 picoseconds.
There are 2 cheats that save 10 picoseconds.
There are 3 cheats that save 12 picoseconds.
There is one cheat that saves 20 picoseconds.
There is one cheat that saves 36 picoseconds.
There is one cheat that saves 38 picoseconds.
There is one cheat that saves 40 picoseconds.
There is one cheat that saves 64 picoseconds.
## Part 1
How many cheats would save you at least 100 picoseconds?

### Approach
- find the optimal track first
- for each part of the track, we try doing a cheat and see if it saves distance

## Part 2

The programs seem perplexed by your list of cheats. Apparently, the two-picosecond cheating rule was deprecated several milliseconds ago! The latest version of the cheating rule permits a single cheat that instead lasts at most 20 picoseconds.

Cheats don't need to use all 20 picoseconds; cheats can last any amount of time up to and including 20 picoseconds (but can still only end when the program is on normal track). Any cheat time not used is lost; it can't be saved for another cheat later.
