# Day 8 (2024)

`Resonant Collinearity` ([prompt](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/8))

Scanning across the city, you find that there are actually many such antennas. Each antenna is tuned to a specific frequency indicated by a single lowercase letter, uppercase letter, or digit. You create a map (your puzzle input) of these antennas. For example:

```
............
........0...
.....0......
.......0....
....0.......
......A.....
............
............
........A...
.........A..
............
............
```

The signal only applies its nefarious effect at specific **antinodes** based on the resonant frequencies of the antennas. In particular, an antinode occurs at any point that is perfectly in line with two antennas of the same frequency - but only when one of the antennas is twice as far away as the other. This means that for any pair of antennas with the same frequency, there are two antinodes, one on either side of them.

The first example has antennas with two different frequencies, so the antinodes they create look like this, plus an antinode overlapping the topmost A-frequency antenna:

```
......#....#
...#....0...
....#0....#.
..#....0....
....0....#..
.#....A.....
...#........
#......#....
........A...
.........A..
..........#.
..........#.
```
Because the topmost A-frequency antenna overlaps with a 0-frequency antinode, there are 14 total unique locations that contain an antinode within the bounds of the map.


## Part 1
Calculate the impact of the signal. How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?

### Approach
- create a dictionary of type of frequency to set of positions
- for each pair of positions, calculate the 2 antinodes and add to set of antinodes
  - check if it's within bounds of the grid
- return len(set)

## Part 2
After updating your model, it turns out that an antinode occurs at any grid position exactly in line with at least two antennas of the same frequency, regardless of distance. This means that some of the new antinodes will occur at the position of each antenna (unless that antenna is the only one of its frequency).

So, these three T-frequency antennas now create many antinodes:

```
T....#....
...T......
.T....#...
.........#
..#.......
..........
...#......
..........
....#.....
..........
```

In fact, the three T-frequency antennas are all exactly in line with two antennas, so they are all also antinodes! This brings the total number of antinodes in the above example to 9.

Calculate the impact of the signal using this updated model. How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?

### Approach
- Same as Part 1 but instead of just calculating 2 antinodes
- We keep a dowhile until antinode generated is out of bound
- Also include the 2 nodes in as positions as well
