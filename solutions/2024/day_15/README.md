# Day 15 (2024)

`Warehouse Woes` ([prompt](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/15))

Because lanternfish populations grow rapidly, they need a lot of food, and that food needs to be stored somewhere. That's why these lanternfish have built elaborate warehouse complexes operated by robots!

These lanternfish seem so anxious because they have lost control of the robot that operates one of their most important warehouses! It is currently running amok, pushing around boxes in the warehouse with no regard for lanternfish logistics or lanternfish inventory management strategies.

Right now, none of the lanternfish are brave enough to swim up to an unpredictable robot so they could shut it off. However, if you could anticipate the robot's movements, maybe they could find a safe option.

The lanternfish already have a map of the warehouse and a list of movements the robot will attempt to make (your puzzle input). The problem is that the movements will sometimes fail as boxes are shifted around, making the actual movements of the robot difficult to predict.

For example:
```
##########
#..O..O.O#
#......O.#
#.OO..O.O#
#..O@..O.#
#O#..O...#
#O..O..O.#
#.OO.O.OO#
#....O...#
##########

```

## Part 1
The lanternfish use their own custom Goods Positioning System (GPS for short) to track the locations of the boxes. The GPS coordinate of a box is equal to 100 times its distance from the top edge of the map plus its distance from the left edge of the map. (This process does not stop at wall tiles; measure all the way to the edges of the map.)

So, the box shown below has a distance of 1 from the top edge of the map and 4 from the left edge of the map, resulting in a GPS coordinate of 100 * 1 + 4 = 104.
```
#######
#...O..
#......
```

The lanternfish would like to know the sum of all boxes' GPS coordinates after the robot finishes moving. 

Predict the motion of the robot and boxes in the warehouse. After the robot is finished moving, what is the sum of all boxes' GPS coordinates?

### Approach
Simulate the movement for each move
- if blocked don't move

## Part 2
reports start coming in that a second warehouse's robot is also malfunctioning.

This warehouse's layout is surprisingly similar to the one you just helped. There is one key difference: everything except the robot is twice as wide! The robot's list of movements doesn't change.

To get the wider warehouse's map, start with your original map and, for each tile, make the following changes:

If the tile is #, the new map contains ## instead.
If the tile is O, the new map contains [] instead.
If the tile is ., the new map contains .. instead.
If the tile is @, the new map contains @. instead.

Predict the motion of the robot and boxes in this new, scaled-up warehouse. What is the sum of all boxes' final GPS coordinates?

### Approach
- Use a BFS to find all connected stones and see if it's a valid move and move it as necessary
