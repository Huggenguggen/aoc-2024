`Reindeer Maze` ([prompt](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/16))

The Reindeer start on the Start Tile (marked S) facing East and need to reach the End Tile (marked E). They can move forward one tile at a time (increasing their score by 1 point), but never into a wall (#). They can also rotate clockwise or counterclockwise 90 degrees at a time (increasing their score by 1000 points).

To figure out the best place to sit, you start by grabbing a map (your puzzle input) from a nearby kiosk. For example:
```
###############
#.......#....E#
#.#.###.#.###.#
#.....#.#...#.#
#.###.#####.#.#
#.#.#.......#.#
#.#.#####.###.#
#...........#.#
###.#.#####.#.#
#...#.....#.#.#
#.#.#.###.#.#.#
#.....#...#.#.#
#.###.#.#.#.#.#
#S..#.....#...#
###############
```

There are many paths through this maze, but taking any of the best paths would incur a score of only 7036. This can be achieved by taking a total of 36 steps forward and turning 90 degrees a total of 7 times:



## Part 1

Analyze your map carefully. What is the lowest score a Reindeer could possibly get?

### Approach
- this is a maze problem so best to use Dijkstra's 
- weight for turning is 1000, moving is just 1


## Part 2
Every non-wall tile (S, ., or E) is equipped with places to sit along the edges of the tile. While determining which of these tiles would be the best spot to sit depends on a whole bunch of factors (how comfortable the seats are, how far away the bathrooms are, whether there's a pillar blocking your view, etc.), the most important factor is whether the tile is on one of the best paths through the maze. 

So, you'll need to determine which tiles are part of any best path through the maze, including the S and E tiles.
